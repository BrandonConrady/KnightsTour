# KnightsTour

## How to Play
The idea of the Knights Tour is simple. You have an 8 by 8 chess board, and must visit every square only once using the Knight piece.
To play, simply click on the square you wish to start on, then drag the piece to the next square.
To the right of the board is an area that displays your move history, as well as 2 buttons for resetting and undoing moves.

This puzzle becomes increasingly difficult as you make more moves, so good luck!
If you find yourself in a square with no possible moves, the game is over.
However, at this point you can either restart or undo your move to try another path.

## Credits
In /assets/icons/ is a source.txt file that provides the source of icon images used within this project.

## Why are there images for the Queen piece in a game that only uses the Knight Piece?
I plan on trying a similar Chess puzzle next, involving the Queen. Stay tuned...
